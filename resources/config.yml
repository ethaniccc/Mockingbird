# If developer mode is enabled, all checks will be enabled,
# which may leave false-positives. This should NEVER be enabled
# on production servers.

## General Settings ##

# You can choose this to be any permission you'd like so
# that staff members get Mockingbird alerts, etc.
alert_permission: "mockingbird.alerts"

# You can choose this permission to anything you'd like.
# This permission is for getting player logs.
log_permission: "mockingbird.logs"

# This is for module permission such as using /mbenable, /mbdisable, and /mbreload
# to enable and disable modules through commands.
module_permission: "mockingbird.modules"

# This is a permission for the screenshare command that will allow the player
# to "screenshare" other a selected player.
screenshare_permission: "mockingbird.screenshare"

# This is a bypass permission you can give to people, this means
# that they will NOT be violated for cheats.
bypass_permission: "mockingbird.bypass"

# Type any prefix you want for AntiCheat alerts.
prefix: "§l§cMockingbird§4>"

# Prefix shown for when a player is punished, (kick, ban, block)
punish_prefix: "§l§b§cMocking§4bird"

# This option is for the max violations a player can get before
# they are punished by Mockingbird
max_violations: 75

# This option is for dynamic violations. For example, if a player
# failed a speed check, and then failed it a second time by the next tick
# (20 ticks a second), they will have 10 - 20 violations added. If they fail a check
# after only 5 ticks, 5 violations will be added, etc.
dynamic_violations: false

# Do you want the player to be kicked, banned, or ip-banned? (You can also choose "none")
# Options: none, kick, ban, ip-ban
punishment_type: kick
# If your punishment type is kick, you can set this to an mount to ban when a player is kicked
# a certain amount of times. For example, if this option is set to 5, and the player is kicked
# 5 times, they will be banned. You can set this to -1 to disable.
max_kicks: -1

# If this option is enabled, this will save the previous data in a .txt file
# with information such as violations and cheats violated for.
save_previous_violations: false

# This is for the TPS level detections should be stopped at.
stop_tps: 18

# This option is for choosing what type of mode you want to use for the
# /log command. There are two options: normal and UI
log_command_type: normal

# This option is for if detected cheats should be suppressed. If a player is
# using speed (moves too fast), Mockingbird will revert their movement. Same for other cheats.
# Some cheats may not be suppressed, such as experimental ones or packet checks.
